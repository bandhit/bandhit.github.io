Now, my blog is blazing fast, totally customizable, and blissfully free of cookie-cutter templates. Who knew building websites could actually be empowering (and kind of fun)?\nThis tutorial guides you through creating a blog using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator, and deploying it with Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.\nPrerequisites Install Hugo Install Git Have an active Microsoft Azure account with Blob Storage setup Basic command-line and text editor familiarity Install Hugo Tips With snap (for Ubuntu) To install Hugo with snap, run:\nsudo snap install hugo With mamba (miniforge system) Personally, I prefer using mamba for package management across multiple-projects. Because it\u0026rsquo;s much faster and less prone to dependency resolution issues. Also, if you’re working in a commercial or government environment, don’t install Anaconda unless your organization has actually purchased a license—otherwise, you could be violating terms of use. Community packages like mamba are free for anyone to use without commercial restrictions.\nTo install Hugo using mamba CLI starting from creating a conda environment, you can follow these steps:\nCreate a new conda environment:\nmamba create -n hugo_env -y Activate the new environment:\nmamba activate hugo_env Install Hugo using mamba from the conda-forge channel:\nmamba install -c conda-forge hugo -y This sequence sets up a mamba environment and installs Hugo efficiently.\nCreate a New Hugo Site Open your terminal and run:\nhugo new site mlablogs cd mlablogs git init This sets up a fresh Hugo project.\nAdd a Theme Choose a theme from the Hugo themes repository. For example, add the Ananke theme:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod echo \u0026#39;theme = \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config.toml You can also change the theme later by editing config.toml, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to verify your submodules in .gitmodules if you need to remove or add more themes.\nAdd Content Create your first blog post:\nmkdir -p content/posts/hello-hugo nano content/posts/hello-hugo/index.md Edit this Markdown file and add your text.\n+++ date = \u0026#39;2025-11-03T12:00:00+09:00\u0026#39; draft = false title = \u0026#39;Hello Hugo\u0026#39; +++ ## Hello Hugo! Hello Hugo! Preview Locally Run:\nhugo server Visit http://localhost:1313 to see your site live locally.\nBuild the Site Generate static files:\nhugo Static files output to the public directory.\nDeploy to Azure Blob Storage Create a Blob Storage container in Azure Portal and set it for static website hosting. Use Azure CLI or Azure Storage Explorer to upload the contents of the public folder to the $web container. Configure your storage account\u0026rsquo;s static website endpoint as your site URL.
